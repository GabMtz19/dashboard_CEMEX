Dashboard created for CEMEX, in which their employees would be able to locate the apps and pieces of software they have access through CEMEX's permissions.


For the code to work, you need to run "npm install" and "npm start" on both, front and backend

In case there's an error while executing "npm install", use the following command and repeat the process:
npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps

Example:

D:\folder_domain> cd .\frontend\

D:\folder_domain\frontend> npm install

D:\folder_domain\frontend> npm start


*Open new terminal

D:\folder_domain> cd .\backend\

D:\folder_domain\backend> npm install

D:\folder_domain\backend> npm start
