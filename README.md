For the program to work, you should run the command "npm install" in both, the frontend and backend.

In case of an error while executing "npm install", use this command and repeat the process:
npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps

Example:

  D:\folder_domain> cd .\frontend\
  
  D:\folder_domain\frontend> npm install
  
  D:\folder_domain\frontend> npm start


*Open new terminal

  D:\folder_domain> cd .\backend\
  
  D:\folder_domain\backend> npm install
